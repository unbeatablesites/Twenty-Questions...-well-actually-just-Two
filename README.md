# Twenty-Questions...-well-actually-just-Two
Make a program which plays a simple game of 2 Questions. The first question should be "animal, vegetable, or mineral?" Then, the second question should be "is it bigger than a breadbox?" Then, display one of six possible responses, depending on their answers. You can choose what answers to give for each of the six possibilities.
